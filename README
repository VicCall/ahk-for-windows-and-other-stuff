Hi
My name is Vic and i only know how to code Auto Hotkey just alittle bit. So proceed with caution.
i made this repository to store my scripts just in case i want to work on it on other computer, but feel fre use it.

This repository contain Auto Hotkey scripts that i took from the macro man himself https://github.com/TaranVH, and i adjusted some stuff that will suits my needs for video editing in adobe premiere pro.
i think these scripts will help you easier to start using AHK on your video editing process because Tarans AHK script files are clustered with some advance stuff that i found it hard to understand.

but still you have to watch Tarans AHK tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3vG8U5RoFw&t=1786s) to set up the AHK program on your computer

PP shorcut location
C:\Users\garel\Documents\Adobe\Premiere Pro\23.0\Profile-garel\Win

Files listed below containing all AHK Functions that called in Parent.ahk file
{
AHK_PP.ahk
Both_Accelerated_Scrolling_1.3_AND_Cursor_click_visualizer-100UI.ahk
PREMIERE_MOD_Right_click_timeline_to_move_playhead.ahk
YES_DELETE_EXISTING_KEYFRAMES.ahk
AudioMonoMaker.ahk
Application_switcher.ahk
presets_pp.ahk
}

so all you have to do is to change the hotkeys  from each function to your liking in Parent.ahk.

{HOTKEY}::{NAME OF THE FUNCTION}()
F1::switchToExplorer()
F2::switchToEdge()
F3::switchToPremiere()
F4::switchToGom()

#IfWinActive ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe  (Functions below this line will only can be activate if Premiere Pro is opened/active)
F5::preset_1("WS-basic")
F6::preset("LC-1")
F7::preset("LC-2")
F8::preset("LC-3")
=::audioMonoMaker("right")
End::RDCAP()    ;Ripple delete clip at playhead
Ins::CAC()      ;Cut at cutsor
PgUp::SCAC()    ;delete single clip at playhead

The only script that i rewrote is the preset_1("WS-basic"), is the instant add custom preset function that for warp stabillizer fx
where i add command to click the anlyze button after the regular preset function, and i bet its sloppy.
